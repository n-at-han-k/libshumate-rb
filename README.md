# libshumate

Ruby bindings for libshumate, the GTK4 map widget.

```ruby
require "libshumate"

Shumate.constants.size  # the whole namespace, from the typelib
```

## How this works, and what it costs to install

The library ships a GObject Introspection typelib — `Shumate-1.0.typelib` — describing
every class, method, property and signal it has. `Shumate::Loader`, about twenty
lines, hands that to ruby-gnome's `GObjectIntrospection::Loader`, which defines
the Ruby classes from it at `require` time.

So this gem is pure Ruby: no extension of its own, no Cargo workspace, no
per-platform binary. You get the whole library rather than the subset somebody
got round to wrapping by hand, and it does not drift when the library gains API.

Be precise about install, though: `gem install libshumate` still compiles C, because
`gobject-introspection` and `glib2` are themselves native extensions built
against glib, so a compiler and glib's development headers are needed. What
this gem adds on top is nothing — those two are what every ruby-gnome
application already has, since `gtk4` depends on them.

## The one thing you must install

The typelib is a C-library artefact, so it belongs to your distribution and
this gem cannot install it:

| | |
|---|---|
| Debian / Ubuntu | `gir1.2-shumate-1.0` |
| Fedora | `libshumate` |
| Arch | `libshumate` |
| nix | `pkgs.libshumate` |

If it is not in the default search path, point `GI_TYPELIB_PATH` at the
directory holding `Shumate-1.0.typelib`. The dev shell in `flake.nix` does this.

**One trap worth knowing.** The typelib must come from the same glib build as
the `gobject-introspection` gem. Mixing two registers GIO twice in one process
and fails with `cannot register existing type 'GTlsCertificate'`. Under nix,
take both from one nixpkgs — and note that glib's typelibs live in its `out`
output, not the default one.

## Development

```sh
nix develop
bin/test
```

## Licence

Apache-2.0. The library itself keeps its own licence; this gem links nothing
and copies no code from it — it reads a description of it at runtime.
